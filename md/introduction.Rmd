# **Welcome to AtSRGA (*<u>A</u>rabidopsis <u>t</u>haliana* <u>S</u>tress <u>R</u>esponsive <u>G</u>enes <u>A</u>tlas)**

### &ensp;AtSRGA is a user-friendly application enabling users to retrieve stress-responsive genes in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. AtSRGA presents stress-responsive genes in a heatmap format based on a stress responsiveness measure (SRscore, see section 2-3 of tutorial). It facilitates the comparative analysis of individual stress responses and groups of genes responsive to multiple stress conditions.<img src = "hexsticker_AtSRGA.png" width = "250px" height = "auto" style="float:right;"> Researchers can identify groups of genes with similar patterns by examining the SRscore pattern of a gene of interest across 11 stress conditions. AtSRGA will enhance the screening of biologically significant stress-responsive genes in Arabidopsis in functional genomics research.
